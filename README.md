Windows 10 ARM64 BSP for Raspberry Pi 3B
===

This is a direct port to ARM64 of the drivers for Windows 10 on Raspberry 3B.

The code is based on Microsoft's BSP for Windows 10 IoT Core, orignal README from Microsoft can be found in README2.md.

This port is not fully tested, but Audio and SDHC drivers are proved to be working, at least to some extent.
